# My React Native App-Foodie-Woody


This app is built using React Native and utilizes the following concepts:

- Basic React Native components (e.g. View, Text, Button, etc.)
- React Hooks for state management
- Consuming an external API (Yelp Fusion)

To run the app, make sure you have React Native installed, clone the repository, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the development server and `npm run android` or `npm run ios` to run the app on an Android or iOS emulator, respectively.
